               Online videos are a very... VERY popular form of media that anyone can make with little to no
               experience or fancy equiptment. Everyone has a phone with a camera that can go toe to 
               toe with what many considered "high end" cameras 15 years ago. Today, I would like to share my
               thoughts on online videos, content creation, and it's effects on the brain. And when I say "the brain",
               I exclusively mean mine. I'm not a doctor, I don't know or care how it effects you. Do whatever you 
               want.

            <p>I don't think anyone has actually ever said that, but doesn't it sound profound? You'd think with 
               words like that I would have a phlisophy degree. No no, I chose to waste my money in an entirely 
               different way. With Juul pods and six-packs.
               <br>
               I've been in the business of videos for the better part of 10 years. I'm 24, but saying that I've spent 
               half of my life doing one thing is a horrifying thought that I do not want infultrating my brain.
            </p>
            <p>
               In my tenure of being chronically online, I have seen many, many videos; some good and some bad (mainly
               bad).
